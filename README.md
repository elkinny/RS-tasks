  <li><a href="http://es6-features.org/#Constants">ES6</a> - JavaScript has grown a lot in the past few years and lot of new features had been added to JavaScript to make it much more powerful and productive programming language</li>
  <li><a href="https://html5book.ru">HTML5</a> - the latest version of Hypertext Markup Language, the code that describes web pages. It's actually three kinds of code: HTML, which provides the structure; Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), which take care of presentation; and JavaScript, which makes things happen.</li>
  <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS3">CSS3</a> - the latest evolution of the Cascading Style Sheets language and aims at extending CSS2.1. It brings a lot of long-awaited novelties, like rounded corners, shadows, gradients, transitions or animations, as well as new layouts like multi-columns, flexible box or grid layouts. Experimental parts are vendor-prefixed and should either be avoided in production environments, or used with extreme caution as both their syntax and semantics can change in the future.</li>
  <li><a href="https://webpack.js.org">Webpack </a> - a static module bundler for modern JavaScript applications. When webpack processes your application, it internally builds a dependency graph which maps every module your project needs and generates one or more bundles.</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_intro.asp">JQuery</a> - is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library. The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.</li>
   <li><a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> - is an open source toolkit for developing with HTML, CSS, and JS. Quickly prototype your ideas or build your entire app with our Sass variables and mixins, responsive grid system, extensive prebuilt components, and powerful plugins built on jQuery.</li>
   <li><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> - designed to build scalable network applications. In the following "hello world" example, many connections can be handled concurrently. Upon each connection the callback is fired, but if there is no work to be done, Node will sleep.</li>
   <li><a href="https://gulpjs.com">Gulp</a> - a toolkit for automating painful or time-consuming tasks in your development workflow, so you can stop messing around and build something.</li>
